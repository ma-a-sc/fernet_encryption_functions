In this repository you will find 4 quick funcitons to encrypt and decrypt an input using fernet.
You have to pass the functions the input and a a valid fernet key.

To encrypt the input you have to call the "input_to_encrypt" function and to decrypt something the "input_to_decrypt" function.
The other two functions (fernet_encrypting, fernet_decrypting) are called within the before mentioned functions and dont need to be called in order to utilize the 
code.
